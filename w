== OSI Model to Describe Network Operations ==

===Layer 7: Application Layer ===
* Protocols
    1. Hypertext Transfer Protocol http and https
        - 
    2. Data Transfer Protocols
        - FTP, sftp and TrivialFTP for small file transfers, ServerMessageBlock SMB for windows shared drive from workstations to other work stations.  
        - SMB:
            - To mount a SMB drive you can "Map network drive" above drives A,B,C,D
        - Email:
            - POP3: Retrieve email from the server
            - IMAP: Retrieve email from the server
            - SMTP: Send email from the server
    3. Authentication Protocols
        - LDAP & LDAPs
    5. Network Service Protocols
        - Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol DHCP, giving workstation an IP address when plugged into the network.
        - DHCP sends out 'offer message', containing:
            - IP Address
            - Subnet Mask
            - Default Gateway
            - DNS Server
            - Other Information
        - DHCP is accessed via command prompt 'ipconfig', delete records via 'ipconfig /release' or add IP via 'ipconfig /renew'
        - DNS/Nameserver: translate IP address to human readable. :54
        - DNS lookup on windows in CMD is nslookup
        - NTP: UTC time
    7. Network Management Protocols
        -  Telnet & SSH
        - Simple Network Management Protocol SNMP: allows devices to send simple messages back to server.
            - When SNMP server says 'walk the tree' it messages all devices on network with numbers called MIBs, management information base, to add to a table all the events happening on devices. 
            - SNMP Trap: when something happens on device, it sends message to SNMP server saying an event happened.
        - Syslog: mechanism to send logs on devices to a syslog server, so the event is recorded, like plugging something into a switch to make it active.
        - RDP: Remote Desktop Protocol, access GUI interface of headless computers. 
    8. Audio and Visual Protocols
        - H.323: video and voice  
        - SIP: VOIP phones, transfers voice to a VOIP gateway
    10. Database Protocols 
        - SQL Databases: 
            * Servers
                - mySQL: open source
                - SQLnet: Oracle
                - SQL Server: Microsoft
            * Language on the server
            * Protocol used to communicate across the network to access the database
      

===Layer 6: Presentation Layer ===
* Don't really use this layer
* IBM created "Extended Binary Coded Decimal Interchange Code" EBCDIC as an alternative to ASCII

===Layer 5: Session Layer ===
* Not important for networking

===Layer 4: Transport Layer===
* Protocols
    - Transmission Control Protocol TCP
        * HTTP uses port 80 and HTTPS uses port 443
        * Port 443 is used by SSL and TLS, which is the same thing.
        * FTP port 20/21, sFTP port 22, and TrivialFTP port 69, SMB port 445 
        * Responsible for building a session and maintaining two end points like client and server.  
            - Initiatias conversations
            - TCP 3 Way Handshake:
                1. SYN
                2. SYN-ACK
                3. ACK
                4. Client ask for server to start sending website data
                5. Server starts sending data back to Client
                6. Fin (when all data is done sending)
                7. FIN-ACK
                8. FIN
                9. FIN-ACK
                10. Somewtimes TCP Reset is sent and a RST commend will stop the conversation, either client, server or a firewall can send a RST
         - User Datagram Protocol UDP
            * No 3 way handshake
            * no reliable communication
            * no sequence numbers and no ack numbers
            * Used for efficient data, but no way to make sure data is good.

* Port Numbers
    - SSL/TLS which is the same thing:443
    - FTP: 20/21, sFTP: 22, TrivialFTP: 69, SMB: 445 
    - POP3: 110/995, IMAP: 143/993, SMTP 25/465
    - LDAP: 389
    - LDAPs: 636
    - DHCP: 67/68 
    - DNS: 53 
    - DNS over HTTPS, DoH: 443 
    - NTP: 389
    - Telnet: 23
    - SSH: 22
    - SNMP: 161/162
    - Syslog: 514

    - SQL Server: 1433
    - 
      
===Layer 3: Network Layer ===
* allows computers to communicate long distance across the network
* Protocols
    - Transmission Control Protocol TCP
    - Internet Protocol IP

===Layer 2: Data Link Layer ===
* Protocols that allow computers to talk to each other locally
* Protocol: Internet Protocol 

===Layer 1: Physical Layer===
* Cables: wireless, copper or glass
* Protocols:
	- Ethernet

== Encapsulation and the OSI Model ==
1. Application Layer breaks up data into Transport Layer
    - Segment: a chunk of data with a transport lawyer header, we put in a source and destination port number, and this port number is going to be directly related to an application layer protocol 
2. Transport layer becomes the payload for the Network Layer which is called a Packet
3. Network Layer packet goes into the Data Link Layer payload into a Frame
    - Frame: a chunk of data with a Data Link layer header
        -- Ethernet MTU(Maximum Transmission Unit) is 1500 Bytes Including Packet Header and Segment header
4. Link Layer sends the Frame down to the Physial Layer which breaks it into ones and zeros, and then that is converted into a signal
